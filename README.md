Introduction
============
Rainboqize is a jquery plugin that makes plain colored text on webpages into pretty rainbows. It is based heavily on http://rainbowcoding.com/how-to-create-rainbow-text-in-html-css-javascript/, with some improvements, namely:

customizations made:
 - made callable on complex HTML nodes; all descendant nodes that are pure text will be found and rainbowized
 - randomized starting location on color wheel instead of always starting at red
 - added derainbowize()
